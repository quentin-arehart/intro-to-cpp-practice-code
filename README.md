# intro-to-cpp-practice-code
Simple beginner CPP programs

These are practice/example labs given by the NYU course Introduction to Programming in C++ from EdX.

This code was created by myself after reading the prompts, and checked that it matched the correct answer. 

I am hoping this is the beginning to graphics/software programming, and want to record my steps for myself and any future potential employer.
